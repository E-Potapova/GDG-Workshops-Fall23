See [recording](https://youtu.be/w0HUGUmxwvU) and [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BmFfjkOL-VyYUoXEMtolhx3PRCUagB_oKViybQX8BDY/edit?usp=sharing).

This workshop covers installing Unity and setting up a new Project.

We also go over the game we will be making throughout the workshops and start working on it.

### Assets Provided
- [`player_temp.pmg`](./player_temp.png)
    - A temporary sprite for our Player character
- If you are looking for the complete `Player.cs` script, please see it in the [next workshop folder](./../2%20Programming/Player.cs).

### Setting Up From Scratch
No `Assets.zip` since we create the Project from scratch during this workshop.
