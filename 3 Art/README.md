# Unity Workshop: Art
In this workshop, we learn to import and set up art sprites, animations, and tile maps. No coding done! (Well, very minimal coding...)

Come back later for workshop recording and slides!

### Assets Provided
- [`Pixel-Art-Sprites.zip`]()
    - TODO
- [`Player.cs`](./Player.cs)
    - The finished version of the script we were working on last workshop
    - I comments to explain what each new line is doing

### Setting Up From Scratch
If you are joining us for this workshop without doing the previous ones, no worries! Follow [these instructions](./../Setting%20up%20a%20Project/README.md) with the `Assets.zip` file included in this folder.
