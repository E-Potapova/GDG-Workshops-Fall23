# Unity Workshop: Art
See [recording](https://youtu.be/PzkZE63R-3w) and [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rO9uPHVs_EtCBU5d4NAMTIS-wCSUHQUT9YNYmObNHT4/edit?usp=sharing).

In this workshop, we learn to import and set up pixel art sprites, tile maps, and animations. No coding done! (Well, very minimal coding...)

### Assets Provided
- [`Pixel-Art-Sprites.zip`](./Pixel-Art-Sprites.zip)
    - A folder containing the following sprites that we will use:
        - `clouds_sheet.png`: Four variations of clouds within one image
        - `enemy.png`: One sprite for our enemy
        - `goal.png`: One sprite for the goal
        - `pickup_health.png`: One sprite used for the health gain pickup
        - `pickup_powerup.png`: One sprite used for the special power-up of speeding up player movement
        - `player_movement_sheet.png`: Four sprites, one of the player standing and facing forward, one of the player jumping, and two for walking
        - `tilemap_dirt.png`: A block of dirt that can be split up 3x3 into 9 pieces that connect seamlessly
        - `UI_health.png`: A heart icon used to indicate how much health the player has
- [`Player.cs`](./Player.cs)
    - The finished version of the script we were working on last workshop
    - Added comments to explain what each new line since the previous version is doing
