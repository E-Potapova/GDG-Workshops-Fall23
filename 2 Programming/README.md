# Unity Workshop: Programming
See [recording](https://youtu.be/ux1-Vj7oZ-I) and [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R2JA7hr6QSY1SUG0ALFbLpj2b_FH120zePGhvIz0QrY/edit?usp=sharing).

In this workshop, we take a deeper dive into what C# is and basic programming concepts.

We also take a look at C# for Unity specifically, and take a look at some of the concepts that appear in the `Player.cs` script.

Lastly, we add a temporary Goal and Enemy object to our prototype!


### Assets Provided
- Nothing that we will be using directly in this workshop
- [`Player.cs`](./Player.cs)
