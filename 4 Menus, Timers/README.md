# Unity Workshop: Menus & Timers
See [recording](https://youtu.be/4hGKcVtZX6E) and [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19ghZdlhtANB9Cn5kbYG__AdaOiaw4GTLhKEqj0lP-2g/edit?usp=sharing).

In this workshop, we cover simple camera movement, making and using Prefabs, flipping our Player during our animations, building and running your game, setting up a power-up object, and a timer for our power-up! (Sorry, we didn't get to actually work on menus today :( )

### Setting Up From Scratch
