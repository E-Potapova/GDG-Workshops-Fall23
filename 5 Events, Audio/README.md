# Unity Workshop: Events & Audio
See [recording](https://youtu.be/lfS5MH_LoBkhttps://youtu.be/lfS5MH_LoBk) and [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hzKqj6YPZzFYOu1_Wsflzjt5p1r44T-LO9AxWwtETEw/edit?usp=sharing).

In this workshop, we learn how to program Unity events for inter-object communication, talking about object-oriented programming practices, as well as setting up a simple audio system with our sound effect clips, and hopefully actually making a simple menu system!

### Assets Provided
- [`SFX.zip`](SFX.zip)
    - A folder containing the following sound effects that we will use:
        - `SFX_Player_Damage.wav`: Sound for when the Player takes any damage
        - `SFX_Player_Jump.wav`: Sound for when the Player jumps
        - `SFX_Player_Land.wav`: Sound for when the Player lands after jumping
        - `README.txt`: TODO

### Setting Up From Scratch
If you are joining us for this workshop without doing the previous ones, no worries! Follow [these instructions](./../Setting%20up%20a%20Project/README.md) with the `Assets.zip` file included in this folder.
