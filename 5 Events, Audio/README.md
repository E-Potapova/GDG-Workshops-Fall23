# Unity Workshop: Events & Audio
In this workshop, we learn how to program Unity events for inter-object communication, talking about object-oriented programming practices, as well as setting up a simple audio system with our sound effect clips, and hopefully actually making a simple menu system!

Come back later for workshop recording and slides!

### Assets Provided
- [`SFX.zip`](SFX.zip)
    - A folder containing the following sound effects that we will use:
        - `SFX_Player_Damage.wav`: Sound for when the Player takes any damage
        - `SFX_Player_Jump.wav`: Sound for when the Player jumps
        - `SFX_Player_Land.wav`: Sound for when the Player lands after jumping
        - `README.txt`: TODO
